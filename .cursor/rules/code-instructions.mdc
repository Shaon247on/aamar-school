Build a modern, animated, modular React-based website UI inspired by https://www.reactbits.dev/showcase.

Design Goals:
- Replicate the **aesthetic, structure, and animation style** used on ReactBits.dev.
- Use **Framer Motion** for smooth animations and transitions.
- Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling (utility-first design, minimal but elegant).
- Components should be modular and clean, similar to ReactBits' architecture.

Sections to Include:
1. **Animated Hero Section**  
   - Full width  
   - Headline and subheading with entrance animation  
   - Primary CTA button with hover animation  
   - Include subtle background shapes or gradients like ReactBits

2. **Component Grid Showcase**  
   - Card-based layout with animations on hover and load  
   - Each card includes title, description, and optional icon/image  
   - Similar to the component cards on ReactBits showcase page

3. **Interactive Feature Section**  
   - Responsive 2â€“3 column layout  
   - Icons or mini components that animate on scroll or hover  
   - Clean headings and supporting text  

4. **Testimonial/Feedback Carousel or Grid**  
   - Motion elements or auto-slide animation  
   - Styled like the testimonial section of ReactBits if present

5. **Sticky or Transparent Navbar**  
   - Animated on scroll  
   - CTA button and logo included

6. **Minimal Footer**  
   - Social icons  
   - Newsletter subscription input  
   - Muted tones, good contrast, and clean layout  

Tech Stack:
- **React + TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Framer Motion**
- **React Vector Icon**
- Optional: **shadcn/ui** for basic UI primitives
- Folder structure: `components/`, `sections/`, `pages/`

Design Style:
- Rounded corners (xl or 2xl)
- Soft drop shadows
- Light theme with playful motion
- Animations should be natural (ease-in-out, spring)
- Spacing and padding should be generous

Additional:
- Make it production-ready for a modern developer tools product or UI library.
- Code should be easy to extend and reuse for other similar sites.
